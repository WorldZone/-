                Microsoft Office is one of the original document editing suites that were available for the PC and Mac
                operating systems. The latest edition of Microsoft Office, the Office 2019 Professional Plus is so far
                the best edition of Office which is centered
                towards enterprises. One of the best things about Office 2019 Professional Plus is that you have to pay
                once for the license instead of paying a monthly subscription as was the case with Microsoft’s
                cloud-oriented Office 365.

                emails. It also functions as a calendar, contacts as well as to-do application along with being a
