                Microsoft Office is one of the original document editing suites that were available for the PC and
                Mac operating systems. The latest edition of Microsoft Office, the Office 2019 Professional Plus is
                so far the best edition of Office which is centered towards enterprises. One of the best things
                about Office 2019 Professional Plus is that you have to pay once for the license instead of paying
                a monthly subscription as was the case with Microsoft’s cloud-oriented Office 365.

                emails. It also functions as a
                calendar, contacts as well as to-do application along with being a powerful email client. It has
